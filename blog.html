                <h1> Women in science in india </h1>
                Women in science are gladiators. In one sense, they are always in combat, tackling challenges on multiple fronts — caste, religion, gender, equality and funding. Anna Mani, Annapurni Subramaniam, Raman Parimala, Rathnashree, Rohini Godbole, Dr V Shanta, Soumya Swaminathan, Sujata Ramdorai — the list of successful Indian women in science goes on on. Unfortunately, women in science were not encouraged for decades.
                
                    <br>
                    <div class="con1"> Anna Mani, a student of Prof C V Raman, was refused a PhD at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), although her dissertation involved ample research work. Unfazed, Mani specialised in meteorological instruments at Imperial College London.After returning to India, she joined the Indian Meteorology Department (IMD). Her contributions have led her to be called the Weather Woman of India.  “The good part is that women become role models very easily. Especially for their kids,  the gender bias is broken down quite early. This is why women in science are important” says Dr Vinita Gowda, Associate Professor, IISER Bhopal. </div>

                <h1> Women In Science </h1>
                43% of STEM graduates in India are women, the highest in the world; yet their share in STEM jobs is just 19%. There are various reasons for this, including lack of role models, pressures to conform to societal norms and trappings of domesticity, stressors related to marriage, childbirth etc., sexual harrasmant and discrimination at work etc. 
                 
                
                    <br>
                    <div class="con2">This is terrible news, considering how much women really bring to the table in STEM fields. 
                        For one, a more representative workforce leads to more exhaustive questions being asked, and problems being targeted from a variety of angles.
                        Especially in engineering, a lot of equipment and technologies are designed for men due to the lack of female engineers. For example, when the seatbelt was first introduced, it was modeled to fit the male body, which led to the loss of lives of many women as their body type wasn’t considered. Similarly, scientists determined the average office temperature in the 1960s. They based it on the metabolic resting rate of an average male. Yet, in recent years, scientists found out that female metabolic rate isn’t the same. In actuality, it’s about 30% higher than that of males.
                        Besides that, there is a surplus of jobs in STEM, and the fact that a large portion of the population is completely cut off from STEM and the wonderful opportunities it provides is a bane to the global economy. With most of the highest paying jobs being STEM jobs, women’s lack of participation also widens the wage gap. 
                        We desperately need more women in STEM, through tackling the many reasons, from a lack of opportunities, to societal pressure on women to not enter STEM.</div>

                <h1> Ms. Manpreet Kalra </h1>
                I, Manpreet Kalra, a woman who works in a STEAM-related area, would want to start by saying how fortunate I am to have the opportunity to think about and share my thoughts on women in STEAM.
                In order to encourage females to pursue STEAM careers, adolescent girls should be taught and made aware of the STEAM professions through skill-based training, mentorships, and educational resources. 
                    <br>
                <div class="con3">We must inspire the next generation of thinkers to pursue careers in STEAM and        computing.
                    STEAM graduates have the opportunity to pursue a number of vocations, including management and leadership roles, due to their unique capacity to conceptualise, analyse, synthesise, interpret, and deduce answers to practical challenges. Their rigorous, systematic, and logical approach to issue resolution is primarily responsible for their success.
                    In addition, we have the power to imagine a better world. In the most cutting-edge fields like robotics, engineering, medicine, and computer technology, you may contribute to the development of a healthier and more sustainable society by using the creativity to find creative solutions to difficult problems.
                    Additionally, there are countless job prospects in engineering, technology, and mathematics. Only around 20% (about) of professionals in this industry are women, which further compounds this shortage. The world thus requires the strength of women. Despite the fact that women have made great progress in the STEAM disciplines, I believe that more must be done to reduce the gender gap in these fields and increase awareness of the importance of STEAM education for women.</div>
